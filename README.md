Updating to Custom Skins for ISXOgre

Download the custom skin ZIP file.

Extract the contents of the ZIP.
Do not leave the files inside a nested folder.

Copy the extracted files into:

C:\Program Files (x86)\InnerSpace\Interface\Skins\EQ2OgreGreen


To prevent the skin from reverting to the default, include an ignore_patchlist file so updates do not overwrite the custom skin.

Place or update the ignore list in:

C:\Program Files (x86)\InnerSpace\Scripts\Extensions


Restart Inner Space or ISXOgre so the custom skin loads and stays in place.
